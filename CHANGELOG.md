# Changelog

All notable changes to NexusCore are recorded here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows
the release ladder in the master build prompt §3.4: `0.1.0` → `0.5.0` → `1.0.0`. Pre-1.0
releases may break data formats **only** with a written migration. From 1.0.0, semantic
versioning applies against the public API.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — M0, walking skeleton

- NeoForge MDK project for Minecraft 1.21.1, Java 21 toolchain, UTF-8 compilation.
- Pinned platform versions: NeoForge `21.1.235`, supported range `[21.1.235,)`, NeoGradle
  userdev `7.1.38`, Gradle wrapper `9.2.1`. Verified against the NeoForged Maven metadata on
  2026-07-25 and recorded in ADR-0001.
- `@Mod` entry point `com.mwtstudios.nexuscore.NexusCore`, bootstrap only.
- Exactly one command: `/nexus version`.
- `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml` as the only metadata file, with all versions expanded from
  `gradle.properties` so metadata cannot drift from the compiled versions.
- Stub-marker gate (`stubMarkerCheck`) failing the build on `TODO`, `FIXME`, "coming soon",
  or `UnsupportedOperationException` in `src/main/java`.
- Checkstyle 10.21.1 as the combined formatting and static-analysis gate, zero tolerance.
- GitHub Actions CI running the full `build`.
- Reproducible archives: stable entry order, no embedded timestamps.
- Sources and Javadoc JARs.
- ADR-0001 (pinned versions), ADR-0002 (zero mixins), ADR-0003 (server-side message
  resolution), ADR-0004 (permission precedence), ADR-0005 (quality-gate tooling).
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

### Notes

- No product logic exists yet. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` is the authoritative record.
- Performance figures in the specification are **targets, not measurements**, until the
  benchmark harness lands at M8.
